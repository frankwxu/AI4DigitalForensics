# AI for Digital Forensics Hands-on Labs

## Overview

Welcome to the **AI for Digital Forensics Hands-on Labs** repository! This repository provides a series of hands-on labs designed for students and faculty to explore the importance and application of AI in digital forensics. Through interactive exercises, you will learn how to train and test AI models, work with datasets, and apply AI techniques to real-world forensic scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Hands-on Labs:** Step-by-step guides to implement AI techniques in digital forensics.
- **Pre-collected Datasets:** Curated online datasets for training and testing AI models.
- **Model Training & Testing:** Learn how to train, evaluate, and optimize AI models.
- **Custom Data Support:** Apply AI models to your own forensic datasets.
- **Google Colab Support:** Run all labs in the cloud with Google Colabâ€”no local setup required.
- **Open-source Code:** All source code is open and modifiable based on student and faculty needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To complete these labs, you will need:

- A Google account (for Google Colab)
- Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with digital forensics fundamentals (recommended)
