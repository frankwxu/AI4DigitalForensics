    "\n",

Landing outside of the landing pad is possible. Fuel is infinite, so an agent could learn to fly and then land on its first attempt.\n",

If the lander crashes, it receives an additional -100 points. If it comes to rest, it receives an additional +100 points. Each leg with ground contact is +10 points. Firing the main engine is -0.3 points each frame. Firing the side engine is -0.03 points each frame. Solved is 200 points.\n",

    "\n",
    "https://www.deepmind.com/publications/human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Begin by initializing the parameters for two neural networks, $Q(s,a)$ (referred to as the online network) and $\\hat{Q}(s,a)$ (known as the target network), with random weights. Both networks serve the function of mapping a state-action pair to a Q-value, which is an estimate of the expected return from that pair. Also, set the exploration probability $\\epsilon$ to 1.0, and create an empty replay buffer to store past transition experiences.\n",
    "2. **Action Selection**: Utilize an epsilon-greedy strategy for action selection. With a probability of $\\epsilon$, select a random action $a$, but in all other instances, choose the action $a$ that maximizes the Q-value, i.e., $a = argmax_aQ(s,a)$.\n",
    "3. **Experience Collection**: Execute the chosen action $a$ within the environment emulator and observe the resulting immediate reward $r$ and the next state $s'$.\n",
    "4. **Experience Storage**: Store the transition $(s,a,r,s')$ in the replay buffer for future reference.\n",
    "5. **Sampling**: Randomly sample a mini-batch of transitions from the replay buffer for training the online network.\n",
    "6. **Target Computation**: For every transition in the sampled mini-batch, compute the target value $y$. If the episode has ended at this step, $y$ is simply the reward $r$. Otherwise, $y$ is the sum of the reward and the discounted estimated optimal future Q-value, i.e.,  $y = r + \\gamma \\max_{a' \\in A} \\hat{Q}(s', a')$\n",
    "7. **Loss Calculation**: Compute the loss, which is the squared difference between the Q-value predicted by the online network and the computed target, i.e., $\\mathcal{L} = (Q(s,a) - y)^2$\n",
    "8. **Online Network Update**: Update the parameters of the online network $Q(s,a)$ using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to minimize the loss.\n",
    "9. **Target Network Update**: Every $N$ steps, update the target network by copying the weights from the online network to the target network $\\hat{Q}(s,a)$.\n",
    "10. **Iterate**: Repeat the process from step 2 until convergence.\n",

    "### Defining the Replay Buffer\n",
    "In the context of RL, we employ a structure known as the replay buffer, which utilizes a deque. The replay buffer stores and samples experiences, which helps us overcome the problem of *step correlation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *deque* (double-ended queue) is a data structure that enables the addition or removal of elements from both its ends, hence the name. It is particularly useful when there is a need for fast append and pop operations from either end of the container, which it provides at O(1) time complexity. In contrast, a list offers these operations at O(n) time complexity, making the deque a preferred choice in cases that necessitate more efficient operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, a deque allows setting a maximum size. Once this maximum size is exceeded during an insertion (push) operation at the front, the deque automatically ejects the item at the rear, thereby maintaining its maximum length.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the replay buffer, the `push` method is utilized to add an experience. If adding this experience exceeds the maximum buffer size, the oldest (rear-most) experience is automatically removed. This approach ensures that the replay buffer always contains the most recent experiences up to its capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sample` method, on the other hand, is used to retrieve a random batch of experiences from the replay buffer. This randomness is critical in breaking correlations within the sequence of experiences, which leads to more robust learning.\n",

    "### Define the DQN Agent\n",
    "The DQN agent handles the interaction with the environment, selecting actions, collecting experiences, storing them in the replay buffer, and using these experiences to train the network. Let's walk through each part of this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initialisation\n",
    "The `__init__` function sets up the agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `self.device`: We start by checking whether a GPU is available, and, if so, we use it, otherwise, we fall back to CPU. \n",
    "- `self.gamma`: This is the discount factor for future rewards, used in the Q-value update equation.\n",
    "- `self.batch_size`: This is the number of experiences we'll sample from the memory when updating the model.\n",
    "- `self.q_network` and `self.target_network`: These are two instances of the Q-Network. The first is the network we're actively training, and the second is a copy that gets updated less frequently. This helps to stabilize learning.\n",
    "- `self.optimizer`: This is the optimization algorithm used to update the Q-Network's parameters.\n",
    "- `self.memory`: This is a replay buffer that stores experiences. It's an instance of the `ReplayBuffer` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step Function\n",
    "The `step` function is called after each timestep in the environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The function starts by storing the new experience in the replay buffer.\n",
    "- If enough experiences have been stored, it calls `self.update_model()`, which triggers a learning update.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Action Selection\n",
    "The act function is how the agent selects an action:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a randomly drawn number is greater than $\\epsilon$, it selects the action with the highest predicted Q-value. This is known as exploitation: the agent uses what it has learned to select the best action.\n",
    "- If the random number is less than $\\epsilon$, it selects an action randomly. This is known as exploration: the agent explores the environment to learn more about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Update\n",
    "The `update_model` function is where the learning happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It starts by sampling a batch of experiences from the replay buffer.\n",
    "- It then calculates the current Q-values for the sampled states and actions, and the expected - Q-values based on the rewards and next states.\n",
    "- It calculates the loss, which is the mean squared difference between the current and expected Q-values.\n",
    "- It then backpropagates this loss through the Q-Network and updates the weights using the optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Target Network Update\n",
    "Finally, the `update_target_network` function copies the weights from the Q-Network to the Target Network. This is done periodically (not every step), to stabilize the learning process. Without this, the Q-Network would be trying to follow a moving target, since it's learning from estimates produced by itself."

    "### Training the Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Training the agent involves having the agent interact with the `LunarLander-v2` environment over a sequence of steps. Over each step, the agent receives a state from the environment, selects an action, receives a reward and the next state, and then updates its understanding of the environment (the Q-table in the case of Q-Learning).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Initial Setup\n",
    "- `scores`: This list stores the total reward obtained in each episode.\n",
    "- `scores_window`: This is a double-ended queue with a maximum length of 100. It holds the scores of the most recent 100 episodes and is used to monitor the agent's performance.\n",
    "-`eps`: This is the epsilon for epsilon-greedy action selection. It starts from `eps_start` and decays after each episode until it reaches `eps_end`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Episode Loop\n",
    "The training process runs over a fixed number of episodes. In each episode:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The environment is reset to its initial state.\n",
    "- he agent then interacts with the environment until the episode is done (when a terminal state is reached).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step Loop\n",
    "In each step of an episode:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The agent selects an action using the current policy (the act method in `DQNAgent`).\n",
    "The selected action is applied to the environment using the step method, which returns the next state, the reward, and a boolean indicating whether the episode is done.\n",
    "- The agent's step method is called to update the agent's knowledge. This involves adding the experience to the replay buffer and, if enough experiences have been collected, triggering a learning update.\n",
    "- The state is updated to the next state, and the reward is added to the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each episode:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The score for the episode is added to `scores` and `scores_window`.\n",
    "- Epsilon is decayed according to `eps_decay`.\n",
    "- If the episode is a multiple of `target_update`, the target network is updated with the latest weights from the Q-Network.\n",
    "- Finally, every 100 episodes, the trained model will be saved and the average score over the last 100 episodes is printed. \n",
